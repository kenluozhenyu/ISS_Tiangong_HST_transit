# Satellite Configuration
# Add satellites here. Each entry maps a display name to its TLE catalog name.
# The system searches all loaded TLE files for matching names.
#
# Format: display_name = TLE_catalog_name
#
# To add custom satellites:
# 1. Place their TLE data in a file (e.g. custom_sats.txt) in the project root
# 2. Add the TLE source filename to [tle_sources] below
# 3. Add the satellite entry under [satellites]
#
# KH-11 Note: These are classified US military satellites. Their TLEs are NOT
# available from Celestrak. You would need to obtain them from:
#   - Space-Track.org (requires free account + login)
#   - Amateur tracking networks (e.g. Mike McCants' classified TLEs)
#   - Manual entry in a custom TLE file

[tle_sources]
# List of TLE files to load (relative to project root)
# The download_tle.py script fetches the first source automatically
